			On Monday, President Elect Donald Trump announced that he would implement a blanket 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on goods from China. In the fiscal year 2023, the value of U.S. agricultural imports exceeded that of exports. 

			David Ortega, a food economist and professor at Michigan State University, believes that this policy would lead to a rise in food prices for consumers. "We import food products that we're not able to grow or produce here domestically," explained Ortega. 

			Additionally, "Agribusinesses rely on what we call intermediary goods, inputs like fertilizer equipment, packaging material in order to produce food domestically. And so if we were to tax those...it would raise the cost of production."

			Ortega predicts that we will see tariff retaliations from other countries, which would further increase food prices for consumers.
